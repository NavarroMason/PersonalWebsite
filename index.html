    <h3>  Why is archeology important?</h3>
    <p>It allows us in todays age to figure out how people used to live and it tells us a lot about history itself. Without archeology we wouldn't know much about acient civilazations because we wouldn't know what they used or what they did. So archeology is very important to understand the past.</p>

<!--<h1>Paleontology</h1>

<p>Archeology is commonly mistaken for paleontology which is the study of fossil animals (particularly dinosaurs) and plants where arcehology is the study of humans and artifacts. While they are very similar and are both evenly amazing archeology tells us something entirely different than paleontology and you can mistakingly find information about the wrong thing.</p>-->
