    <p>There are different types of jobs in archeology that serve different purposes and are all equally amazing and are all equally important in archeology and history. Also there are other jobs connected to archeology or are similar to archeology for example paleontology which is the study of plants and fossils where you do the same thing and because of archeology and paleontology we have artifacts and fossils in museums which are neat to learn about.</p>
