    <p>Even in archeology somethings that people find are unexplainable. There are some discoveries that don't make sense how they got there or what they are. Also myths and rumors can be apart of finding archeological places like atlantis or Noah's ark that people say they have found but it is mostly likely a lie. Archeology is very important because there are somethings in history that are unknown and archeologists try to understand the unknown.</p>
