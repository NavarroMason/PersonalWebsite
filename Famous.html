    <p> These are just some of many famous archeological discoveries and because of archeologists we now know where these discoveries are, when they were first established, and what early humans did during their time periods.This shows that archeology is very important because if for example someone never found the rosetta stone we wouldn't know much about egyptian history.</p>
